# Teaching Field Experiments with Games of Skill or Chance

*Principal Investigator: Elizabeth Paluck, Princeton University Department of Psychology, with J. Nathan Matias and Jason Chin.*

By offering this game, we are inviting you to take part in a voluntary research study. Before you decide to participate, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve.

The purpose of this research is to **find out if changing the design of the game influences scores on average, regardless of your prior experience at similar games**.

If you participate, we will ask you to take a number and answer questions about your  physical ability and prior experience. You will then play the game while we record your score. 

**Confidentiality**: Your name will never be associated with the information we collect, and we will never mention anyone's name in class assignments or research publications.

The benefits of playing this game are that you get to play a game, the feeling you get from winning, and from learning the answer. The risks of playing this game mostly involve the disappointment you may feel if you lose.

If you prefer not to play the game, let us know, and you can help in some other way. Participation is voluntary, no one is obligated to play, and you can stop at any time. The decision to participate or not participate will not have an effect on your course grade, your relationship with the professor, or the university.

This research is only open to people who are 18 years or older. If you are eligible and you consent to participate, **please begin the study by taking a number, answering the survey, and preparing to play the game**.
