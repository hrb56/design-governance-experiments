# SOC412 Assignments and Example Code
SOC 412: Designing Field Experiments at Scale. Public repository for assignments and example code.

**I taught this class at Princeton University in 2017 and 2018. [Now that I'm at Cornell](https://medium.com/@natematias/im-joining-the-cornell-university-department-of-communication-a4afcc675836), I'm adapting the course for a new context. I'll leave this up as an archive, will fork the repository for my Cornell class, and will link to the most recent version once it's up.**
