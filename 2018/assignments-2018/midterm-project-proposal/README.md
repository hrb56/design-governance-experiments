## Overview

### Project Proposal
The first part of the midterm is a project proposal that will be submitted by the group. This will be half of your midterm grade.

The purpose of your project proposal is to provide your team a chance to formalize how you plan to approach the project you take on, to describe the major parts of the project, and to craft an initial timeline. A draft **Google Doc** of the proposal is due by **March 8 at 5pm** and the full proposal will be due by **March 14th at 9pm** .

I will send each team an empty Google Doc over slack.

### Final Essay Proposal
The second part of the midterm is a three-paragraph proposal due **March 14th at 9pm** for the essay that you will individually write as part of your final. The final essay will be a 1200 - 1500 word essay that unpacks or makes an argument about one of the topics we have explored in class, in relation to the experiment that you developed with your team. You can pick anything from the syllabus as a starting point (or discuss others with me). For example, possible topics include:
* Libertarian Paternalism
* Consent
* Research Accountability
* Research Transparency  & Privacy
* Corporate Accountability
* External validity
* Replication
* Explanation & Description
* Advancing Science and Pragmatic Knowledge

In this three-paragraph proposal, you will:
* Introduce the topic
* Explain how it relates to your team project
* Say more about the kind of essay you think you will write (Will you argue for a particular choice? Will you critique a decision in the project? Will you propose a new way of seeing that issue? etc...)
* Include a bibliography with 3-5 references that you are going to start with
