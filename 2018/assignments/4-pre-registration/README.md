## Background: Online Interplanetary Exo-Biology Communities 
In this class assignment, carried out in teams of two or three, imagine that you are approached by an community on reddit that discusses the botany of planets outside of Earth. In this imagined timeline, humanity has spread across the stars and primarily communicates through digital means. Because  participants are scattered across the galaxy, they rely on an online community to distribute knowledge, discover people who share their interests, and even sometimes find jobs in exo-biology. They sometimes have fierce disputes about genetics, the nature of life, environmental issues, and the politics of galactic exploration, but it's a complicated universe, and they need each other. 

The community asks you replicate an experiment that tested the effect of welcome messages on community participation. You have already designed the study, [conducted a power analysis](https://github.com/natematias/SOC412/tree/master/3-power-analysis), and decided how many posts to included in the study. Your role is to be an evaluator to support the community that is implementing the project. 

Because you want to improve public trust in your research by limiting your discretion after the study has concluded, you plan to publish a pre-analysis plan for your study. This document can also be used to confirm details of your study with the community before proceeding. When you go to publish the results with an academic publisher, you will also be able to share the pre-registration plan with reviewers.

## Purpose of the assignment
This assignment will give you a chance to write a pre-analysis plan, which you will create for the project you take on for the final. 

## Materials for this assignment
For this assignment, use the materials from the [Week 4 power analysis assignment](../3-power-analysis/). As you craft your pre-analysis plan, take a look at the following examples

* The pre-analysis plan for the [2015 Miami Transgender Experiment](http://egap.org/registration/1234) by David Broockman and Joshua Kalla ([written about in the NYT here](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/08/science/doorstep-canvassing-can-shift-views-on-transgender-rights-study-finds.html))
* The pre-analysis plan for [my r/science experiment](https://osf.io/jhkcf/) in 2016 (your dependent variables are different)
* The pre-analysis plan from Don Green's lab for [a test of police-worn body cameras](https://osf.io/hpmrt/). Here's [the amazing website where they reported the results](http://bwc.thelab.dc.gov/) (all null findings, which were super valuable!)

## Assignment
This assignment, which is due Friday at 5pm, has two parts. First, submit (in teams) submit a pre-analysis plan in a Word document with the following sections:

* Introduce the study and the motivations (feel free to re-use from previous assignments) 
* Describe the experiment **procedure** you plan to use
** In the experiment procedures, specify how many observations you expect the experiment to run (the chart won't be necessary)
* Describe the **outcomes** being measured
* Describe the **estimation procedures**, including the specific lines of code you would plan to use

In the second part of the assignment, which can be included in second section of the Word document, imagine that you were having a public conversation with a large community. What would you say to the following statements? If it's appropriate, refer to your pre-analysis plan. Responses should be no longer than 4 sentences. 

> **GalagaGenius19**: These messages suck. For those of us on mobile phones, it's annoying to scroll past them. It won't make anything better, why are you wasting our time?

> **MrAsteroid999**: This is just another example of the censorship and efforts to manipulate our lives by the reddit company. Stop messing with our lives, Princeton; we're not on your planet anymore!

> **FearMyBotanyPowers27**: This isn't real science. Most of the social sciences are just hand-waving anyway, since they can't control for unknown factors (I know space has messed with my head, rite?) and since all these studies have samples that are waay too small for the diversity of human experience out here in the 'verse.

> **Sector28Counselor**: While I don't mind scrolling past these messages, I do worry that we'll lose some people. Are we really sure we want to risk that with this study?
