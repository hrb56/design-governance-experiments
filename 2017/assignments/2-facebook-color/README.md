## Background

In this class assigment, carried out in teams of two or three, you will be expected to carry out a randomized trial over a 1-2 week period, combine data from your findings, analyze the results, and report what you found. The basic structure of the Social Media Color experiment is based on the [Facebook Poem Experiment](https://github.com/natematias/SOC412/blob/master/1-facebook-poem/README.md) from last week. The purpose of this assignment is to give you a first opportunity to conduct an experiment live on the web.

## Purpose of the assignment
This assignment will support you to:

* Complete a full field experiment from start to finish in two weeks
* Think about the ethics of experimentation with the people in your life, as a precursor to doing experiments in other people's lives
* Debrief people about the experiment process
* Communicate experiment results to a public audience
* Collect data that we will be able to use to analyze multiple field experiments

## Study Procedure
To conduct this study, you will need to carry out the following procedures:

* Each person on your team should pick something that you could routinely be expected to share on social media most days (a description of your food, a quote, a joke)
* Use Facebook's [Custom Privacy settings](https://www.facebook.com/help/459934584025324) to **exclude anyone who you know who is younger than 18 years old**. Whenever you make a post in this experiment, please use the "Friends Except" feature and select this exclusion list (read more about [Facebook's restricted lists](https://www.facebook.com/help/200538509990389?helpref=faq_content)).
* Each person on the team **publishes a post once a day**:
  * Randomly assign that post to receive a **plain** or [**color** background](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/facebook-status-background-color/)
  * Make a record about the message you are about to post:
    * Record the **number of characters** used in your message (the spreadsheet has example code. If you prefer not to share the text of your messages, just enter the number)
    * **Predict the popularity** of the post and enter the value in the spreadsheet *(from 1 to 5 where 1 means that you expect no one to engage, and 5 means you expect the post to be among your most popular)*
  * **Make a record about the previous day's message** at the same time you make a new post, roughly after 24 hours:
    * The number of Likes, Shares, and Comments received by the item
    * If you miss a day, record NONE under LIKES/COMMENTS/SHARES (try very hard not to miss a day)
  * **Do not reply to your post** over the next 24 hours
  * **Decide how you will engage** with apparent experiment posts from friends in the class, and be consistent (never engage, always engage) 
* After you complete the experiment **debrief people online** by posting a message (see below)
* At the end of the assignment:
  1. **Combine data** with your partner(s)
  2. Use [the code and statistics from the Facebook Poem Experiment](https://github.com/natematias/SOC412/tree/master/1-facebook-poem) to **estimate your results**
  3. **Write an essay** similar to the one you wrote in week one, based on your own data

Data about the study can be stored in an Excel spreadsheet like the one in this folder (*Facebook Color RCT Example Spreadsheet SOC 412.xls*), or it can be stored using a copy of [this Google Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z6j_AURC_VluabPciCSp0Mv0HCtmLqZUt6eXemO27dw/edit?usp=sharing).


## Relating To Your Friends on Social Media
How might your friends respond to the fact that you are conducting a field experiment in your own social network? In my experience, the response to the debriefing has been mostly positive. This research protocol does not involve notifying anyone in advance about the specific design of the study because it would essentially create an unequal opportunity for consent. However, you may wish to post a note explaining in general terms that you are taking a field experiments class this semester, and that you may analyze some of your own social media data as part of the class. 

All studies involve debriefing, and you will be expected to share the results of your part of the research with your social media feeds.

If you do not feel comfortable conducting this study in your own social network, you will be provided with an alternative assignment, the [Cornhole Challenge](https://github.com/natematias/SOC412/tree/master/2-cornhole-challenge). You will need to agree with your partner on which assignment to take on, so please make a decision ASAP. **Declining to conduct this study will not reflect on your grades and will not affect your standing with the instructor, your department, or Princeton University.**

## Debriefing Participants
After completing the study, please debrief the people who follow you on social media by posting a message like this one:

![Example debriefing text: Hi friends, if you've enjoyed or clicked on a poem I posted this month, you've also been part of an experiment I'm thinking about asking my class this spring to attempt. I wanted to try the simplest possible A/B testâ€“ something that wouldn't even require special data collection software. So over the last 22 poems, I randomly altered whether I used the colored background or a basic text background (after choosing the poem) and then recorded the result roughly the next day. What did I learn? First, while several of you *really* loved the poems, and while I think it's one of the best things I've done on social media lately, discussions of poems received 9 comments/likes on average, with a maximum of 19. By randomly assigning poems to get a colored background, I learned that choosing the colored background *does* have an effect. Poems with a colored background had an incidence rate of likes & comments that was 77% higher than the standard white background. What do you think?](jnm-example-debriefing.png)

## Research Ethics and Privacy
This study has been approved by the [Princeton Institutional Review Board](https://www.princeton.edu/ria/human-research-protection/). If you carry out this study, you will be added to the research as a co-investigator and will have access to data from this study. Here are other things you will want to know:

* Other students will **analyze data from your study** later in the course
* Findings from this study will be **submitted to an academic publication** focused on teaching statistics and data science. **Students are invited to be co-authors** on this paper, if you are interested
* **Data from this course will be made public** as part of open access classroom materials and as part of any academic publications about this collective study. The dataset will include:
  * Anonymized team ID
  * Anonymized Experimenter ID
  * Condition
  * Text Length
  * Likes
  * Comments
  * Shares
  * Interactions
  * Popularity Prediction
  * Number of Facebook Friends, fuzzed with a +-20 randomly-sampled integer to limit re-identification

## Assignment
For this assignment, work in pairs to discuss your intervention, create experiment records, check in on research validity, and write results. 

In the **first week**, you will be expected to produce draft materials for communicating your findings to the people who follow you on social media. These materials should include analysis from your first week of data collection and should include several short paragraphs:
* a paragraph **describing the experiment design**
* a paragraph **summarizing the findings**
* a statement about research ethics
* graphics:
  * displaying the interventions
  * illustrating the findings
* questions that you expect you might be asked, with possible answers

Please submit the assignment via Blackboard in HTML or Word format using the naming convention SURNAME1-SURNAME2-FACEBOOK-COLOR-1.doc

In the **second week**, you will use the data from the full two-week experiment to calculate your results and debrief your followers. You will then submit the following assignments:
* a **4-6 paragraph personal essay** that reflects on the experience, and on the reaction of your followers, in light of our readings on research ethics. You are encouraged to discuss ideas with your partner, but your essay should be solely your own work
* A **joint essay reporting your results**: this essay combines data from both of your studies and reports the collective results (details TBA)
